# Team project to taste the work with the Similarity Renormalization Group

This project created to give the taste of the Similarity
Renormalization Group (SRG) theoretical framework to the group
students of the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University.  As
the side-effect, they will learn practices of collaborative code
development through the usage of Revision Control Software (in
particular, Git) and some simplified versions of the coding
disciplines and conventions.

The theoretical physics aim of the project is to solve SRG
differential flow equation for evolution of spin-independent two-body
interactions in one dimention.  See more at `formalism/srg_1d.pdf`.

 ode_solver: - solves the SRG evolution equation 
               according to Eq.(8) starting from
               a bare potential V_{s=0} 

             
             - uses following routines:
                          (1) vsep   == potential
                          (2) derivs == RHS of Eq.(8)
                          (3) gauleg == integration pts 
                          (4) trns   == map to infty 
                          (5) rk4m   == rk4 subroutine/
                                        ode solver 


              - use the script "ode.sh" to compile and  
                run


              - output is written in "vkpotN.out" where
                N is an integer and N: s=N*h, where h is
                the step size in s.
            
              - sample outputs are included for different
                values of N.
